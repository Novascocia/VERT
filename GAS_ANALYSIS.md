# Gas Usage Analysis

## Current Contract Gas Usage

**Measured Gas Costs:**
- VERT mint: ~179,087 gas (~$0.30 at current gas prices)
- VIRTUAL mint: ~181,036 gas (~$0.30 at current gas prices)

## Why Higher Than Previous Contracts?

### Current Contract Operations During Mint:

1. **Payment Processing**
   - `transferFrom()` to collect payment (~23,000 gas)
   - Split VERT payment: 75% treasury, 25% prize pool (~46,000 gas for 2 transfers)

2. **NFT Minting**
   - `_safeMint()` (~50,000 gas)
   - `_setTokenURI()` (~20,000 gas)

3. **Rarity System**
   - Calculate rarity using blockhash + tokenId (~5,000 gas)
   - Store rarity in mapping (~20,000 gas)

4. **Prize System**
   - Calculate prize amount (~3,000 gas)
   - Potentially pay out prizes (if won) (~46,000+ gas)
   - Update prize pool (~5,000 gas)

5. **Events & Bookkeeping**
   - Emit multiple events (~5,000 gas)
   - Update nextTokenId (~5,000 gas)

**Total: ~179,000+ gas**

### Simple ERC721 Contract Would Only Do:

1. **Basic Minting**
   - `_safeMint()` (~50,000 gas)
   - `_setTokenURI()` (~20,000 gas)
   - Update counter (~5,000 gas)

**Total: ~75,000 gas (~$0.15)**

## Gas Optimization Options

### Option 1: Accept Current Costs
- **Pros**: Full feature set, immediate prizes, complex game mechanics
- **Cons**: Higher gas costs (~$0.30 per mint)

### Option 2: Simplify Mint Function  
- Move rarity assignment to post-mint
- Move prize calculation to separate claim function
- **Result**: ~100,000 gas (~$0.20 per mint)

### Option 3: Batch Operations
- Allow multiple mints in one transaction
- Amortize fixed costs across multiple NFTs
- **Result**: Lower per-NFT cost for bulk minting

## Recommendation

The current gas cost (~$0.30) is reasonable for the complexity of operations:
- Real-time prize payouts
- Rarity assignment during mint  
- Automatic prize pool funding
- Treasury splits

This is comparable to other complex NFT projects with game mechanics.
